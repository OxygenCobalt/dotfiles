# dotfiles

Miscellanious dotfiles I cobbled together with luck and stackoverflow. Currently these are mostly useless and only
exist as a backup, but hopefully I'll make it into something more cohesive.

#### Goals:
- Back up configs for certain programs
- Keep track of Font/GTK configurations [See submodules]
- Create a nice awesomewm theme [Eventually]
- Create a cohesive color scheme based off of visiblue [Eventually]

#### Reccomended:

*Warning: Incomplete list, will create a full list as soon as I have to make another install*
