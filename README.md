# dotfiles

Miscellanious dotfiles I cobbled together with luck and stackoverflow. Currently these are mostly useless and only
exist as a backup, but hopefully I'll make it into something more cohesive.

#### Goals:
- Back up configs for certain programs
- Keep track of Font/GTK configurations [See submodules]
- Create a nice awesomewm theme [Eventually]
- Create a cohesive color scheme based off of visiblue [Eventually]

#### Reccomended:

- [kitty](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/kitty)
- A `.face` image file in the home directory [used by neofetch]
- [Inconsolata](https://github.com/googlefonts/Inconsolata)
- [Flat Remix Blue Darkest Solid NoBorder](https://github.com/daniruiz/flat-remix-gtk)
